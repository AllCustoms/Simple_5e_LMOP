# **Welcome to AllCustoms's Simple 5e Lost Mines of Phandelver Campaign** 
Starting out using Map tools as a DM, I needed a premade Campaign to get the hang of due to the complexity of creating your own campaign. So I thought that using this [Base](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;t=25362) which includes a campaign and a built-in 5e framework would be smooth sailing but it was all but smooth sailing due to its complicated nature. So I thought that to create a simple easy to use campaign I would have to port it over to a Simpler Framework like Melek's Simple 5e Framework. 
Here is the Utility Map

## Included Addons
- [Bobifle's Drop-in 5e Monsters](https://github.com/bobifle/tokens). All the Basic Rules monsters and monsters from the Tome of Beasts. Optional support for these tokens is built into the Simple5e campaign file.
- [Merudo's 5e Spell Library](https://github.com/Merudo/spell-library/releases/latest). This addon requires MapTool 1.6.1+, and will give you instant access to nearly every 5e spell. It is HIGHLY recommended!
- [Illydth's Spell States](https://github.com/Illydth/issSpellStates). Keep MUCH better track of spell effects and get a bunch of additional, well thought-out utility states and campaign macros. This addon requires MapTool 1.6.1+. Simple5e 2.2+ includes all the Campaign Token Properties and States needed so all you need are the tokens and tables. If you want your states to all follow the same aesthetic Illydth has both provided instructions and bundled versions of Simple5e with Spell States for you (and even ones with Bag of Tricks!).
- [Wolph42's 'Drop-in' Bag of MT Tricks](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?p=274499). Gives a large amount of customization but most importantly this is used to create Teleport Pads. To move from Map to Map from the Utility Map
