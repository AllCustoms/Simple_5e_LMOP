# **Welcome to AllCustoms's Simple 5e Lost Mines of Phandelver Campaign** 
Starting out using Map tools as a DM, I needed a premade Campaign to get the hang of due to the complexity of creating your own campaign. So I thought that using this [Base](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;t=25362) which includes a campaign and a built-in 5e framework would be smooth sailing but it was all but smooth sailing due to its complicated nature. So I thought that to create a simple easy to use campaign I would have to port it over to a Simpler Framework like Melek's Simple 5e Framework. 

Here is the Utility Map

- [Wolph42's 'Drop-in' Bag of MT Tricks](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?p=274499). Gives a large amount of customization but most importantly this is used to create Teleport Pads. To move from Map to Map from the Utility Map

## Simple 5e LMOP V1.0 Framework features:
- 5e Lost Mines Of Phandelver Campaign Maps and Enemies all of which can Easily be used by DM through Macros. Including NPC all with fully playable Macro Sets  

-	Bag Of Tricks Using Teleport Pads to move Tokens from Map to Map
- Configure Token lets you set a token's name/race/class, hit dice, attributes, proficiency, and AC/HP. This macro directly calls the 'Tweak Token' and 'Validate Token' macros to reduce redundancy and show how to use the macro roll option.
-	Tweak Token lets you quickly adjust oft-changed attributes like AC, HP, Speed, and a few others.
-	Validate Token helps reset defaults on tokens to make sure they work with the token macros.
-	Create Action let you create either paired macros (for separated attack and damage rolls) or single actions on a wide button. These actions will be sorted and colour-coded by action type (Action/Bonus Action/Reaction).
-	Custom Counters can track spells, ability use, ammo, and more. They work with the Create Action and Sheet macros to provide quick and easy tracking, a lot like manual counters when playing face to face. The system uses JSON, but is very automated and optional and can be ignored.
-	NPC Damage, Healing, and Initiative macros which work on selected NPC tokens.
