# Simple_5e_LMOP
[b][size=200]Welcome to AllCustoms's Simple 5e Lost Mines of Phandelver Campaign [/size][/b] This is my first post so tell me If I made any mistakes. Starting out using Map tools as a DM, I needed a premade Campaign to get the hang of due to the complexity of creating your own campaign. So I thought that using this [url]https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;t=25362[/url] which includes a campaign and a built-in 5e framework but it was all but smooth sailing. So I thought that to create a simple easy to use campaign I would have to port it over to a Simpler Framework like Melek's Simple 5e Framework.
